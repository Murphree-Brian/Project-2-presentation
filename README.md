This repository contains a link to the DU Cybersecurity Bootcamps Project 2, and shows critical analysis of Red Team, the attacking side of a penetration test, and Blue team, on the observation and reporting side of the attack.
In essence, this basic capture the flag was used to determine the efficiency of how I as a student could use a pentration testing techniques, and then using an ELK stack, not dissimilar to the one that I had created previously, was able to track the attack attempts that I had on the Kibana system, as well as recommend the proper updates, alarm changes, and mitigation methods.
